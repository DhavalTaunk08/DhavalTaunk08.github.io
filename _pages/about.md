Hi, I am a data scientist from India. Currently, I am pursuing MS by Research from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in). Here, I am part of [iREL](https://irel.iiit.ac.in/) lab and guided by [Prof. Vasudeva Varma](https://irel.iiit.ac.in/vasu/) and [Prof. Manish Gupta](https://sites.google.com/view/manishg/).

My primary area of research lies in the area of Encyclopedic Text Generation for low resource Indic languages. Apart from that, I have also worked on other NLP based problems such as Question-Answering, Transliteration etc. and a couple of Vision based problems as well.

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from [IIITDM Jabalpur](https://iiitdmj.ac.in). After that I had worked as a Data Scientist at [Yes Bank](https://yesbank.in). I have also interned at [Jio Haptik Technologies Ltd.](https://haptik.ai) as Machine Learning Intern and at [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in) as Research intern.
