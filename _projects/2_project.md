I did this project during my stint at [Yes Bank](https://yesbank.in) as a data scientist. The project aims to identify potential small scale industries as customers and help them in growing their business. 

Implemented this task by training BERT as a multilabel classifier model that can classify an industry to its related industry and sub-industry category based on its given description.

Tools used: Python, PyTorch, Huggingface's Transformers
