I did this project in the course Information Retrieval and Extraction during my MS by Research @ IIITH. The goal of the project is to build a search engine from scratch. Wikipedia dump of size 84GB is used to create the index. Along with it, searching functionality was also implemented usin TF-IDF scores.
